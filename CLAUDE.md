# Leadpoet PydanticAI Harness agent guide

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` must remain byte-identical.

## Purpose

This repository contains one open-source PydanticAI harness for live B2B
company sourcing. Keep it independent from competition-host deployment and
persistence, and scoped to the public competition contract.

## Simple competition boundary

The fixed contract is only `run_icp(icp) -> list[dict]`, the documented input
and output shapes, host-supplied approved APIs, and external time and cost
limits. Competitors can change the model, harness, prompts, routing, tools, and
dependencies.

Do not add Git or GitHub attestation, commit or corpus hashes, manifests,
receipts, replay proofs, or compatibility layers. Do not add production
deployment, autoresearch, miner, validator, or chain code.

## Data and tests

Never commit credentials, private ICP payloads, provider responses, or customer
data. Credentials must come from environment variables. Live scored tests must
use real ICPs and real provider calls; do not replace them with mocks. Keep
deterministic unit tests small and focused.
